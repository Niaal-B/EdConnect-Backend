## Installation

### Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git

### Quick Start

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/edconnect.git
cd edconnect
```

Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

Configure your environment files with appropriate values for database connections, API keys, and service URLs.

Start the application with Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Initialize the database:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/v1
- Admin interface: http://localhost:8000/admin

### Manual Development Setup

For local development without Docker:

**Backend setup:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

**Frontend setup:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Required services:**
- PostgreSQL database running on port 5432
- Redis server running on port 6379
- Celery worker process for background tasks


## üß™ Development Workflow

### üê≥ Accessing Docker Services

#### Django Container
```bash
docker exec -it django_app bash
Database Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it postgres_db psql -U myuser -d mydb
üí≥ Stripe Webhooks
Run the following command to listen for Stripe events and forward them to your local API:

bash
Copy
Edit
stripe listen --forward-to localhost/api/bookings/stripe-webhook/

## Usage

### Getting Started

After installation, create your first account through the web interface. Students should complete their academic profile including target universities and areas of interest. Mentors need to verify their current university enrollment and specify their areas of expertise.

The matching system considers factors like academic discipline, target universities, and geographical preferences to suggest relevant mentor-student connections.

### Development Workflow

Create a feature branch for new development:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Docker Services

Access running services for debugging:
```bash
# Backend application shell
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py shell

# View application logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

## Development Roadmap

### Short Term
- Enhanced matching algorithm using machine learning

### Medium Term
- Group mentorship sessions and webinar capabilities
- Advanced analytics for tracking student progress

### Long Term
- Integration with university databases for automatic verification
- Multi-language support for global accessibility
